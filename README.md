# Live-Facecam-Filter

This project combines the use of an external API called webcam easy [https://www.npmjs.com/package/webcam-easy] and a custom filter which I developed.

It allows for a custom choice of whether the filter uses symbols, numbers, or letters to display the image.

It also allows for three color options: multicolor (more accurate image), greyscale, (RGB values all the same), and single color (Black).
